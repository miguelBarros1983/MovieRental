P1 - The rental class has a method to save, but it is not async, can you make it async and explain to us what is the difference?

R: Essentially, the difference is whether the thread becomes blocked or not.
   Synchronous (original implementation): the thread is blocked while waiting for the database
   operation to complete. If we consider multiple simultaneous requests, having several blocked
   threads may cause timeouts, delayed responses, or even exhaust the server's thread pool.
   
   Asynchronous (updated implementation): the thread is not blocked. Once the database operation
   finishes, execution continues. When using Entity Framework in APIs, it's recommended to use
   asynchronous methods whenever possible due to performance benefits.

P2 - "In the MovieFeatures class, there is a method to list all movies, tell us your opinion about it.

R: I believe that, in addition to using async, it would be recommended to apply some filtering
   to avoid retrieving very large result sets. A good suggestion would be to implement a limit,
   for example, pagination.
   
   More generally speaking about the application design, I would say that directly calling the
   DbContext, exposing the entities, and having no exception handling are not ideal practices.
